# Hangman

**Word Guessing Game with Visuals**

This script implements a simple Hangman game. The player has to guess letters in a word and if they guess incorrectly too many times, they lose the game. This Hangman game was created as a way to further learn about basic concepts in Python programming.

**Basic Concepts Learned**

- Input and Output
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional Statements
- Modules
- Functions
- Clearing the Screen

**How to Play**

- Run the hangman.py script using Python3
- The game will select a random word from the imported word list
- The player has to guess letters in the word one at a time
- If the player guesses a letter that is in the word, it will be added to the blanks
- If the player guesses a letter that is not in the word, they will lose a life
- The player has six lives before they lose the game
- If the player correctly guesses all the letters in the word, they win!

**Additional Files**

- The ASCII art for the hangman stages was sourced from the asciiart module.
- The list of words for the game was sourced from the word_list module.
